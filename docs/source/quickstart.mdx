# Quickstart

ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore was designed with one goal in mind: make training and evaluation straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of IPUs.

There are two main classes one needs to know:

- IPUTrainer: the trainer class that takes care of compiling the model to run on IPUs, and of performing training and evaluation.
- IPUConfig: the class that specifies attributes and configuration parameters to compile and put the model on the device.

The `IPUTrainer` is very similar to the [ðŸ¤— Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer), and adapting a script using the Trainer to make it work with IPUs will mostly consists of simply swapping the `Trainer` class for the `IPUTrainer` one. That's how most of the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples) were adapted from their [original counterparts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch).

Original script:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# A lot of code here

# Initialize our Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,  # Original training arguments.
    train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset if training_args.do_eval else None,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)
```


Transformed version that can run on IPUs:

```python
from optimum.graphcore import IPUConfig, IPUTrainer, IPUTrainingArguments

# A lot of the same code as the original script here

# Loading the IPUConfig needed by the IPUTrainer to compile and train the model on IPUs
ipu_config = IPUConfig.from_pretrained(
    training_args.ipu_config_name if training_args.ipu_config_name else model_args.model_name_or_path,
    cache_dir=model_args.cache_dir,
    revision=model_args.model_revision,
    use_auth_token=True if model_args.use_auth_token else None,
)

# Initialize our Trainer
trainer = IPUTrainer(
    model=model,
    ipu_config=ipu_config,
    # The training arguments differ a bit from the original ones, that is why we use IPUTrainingArguments
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset if training_args.do_eval else None,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)
```
